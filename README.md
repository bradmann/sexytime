jquery sexytime plugin
======================

timestamps never looked so hot
------------------------------

Sexytime is a jquery plugin that automatically converts your boring timestamps into natural language time descriptors, and automatically updates them live on the page. It has a fully cusomizable grammar that can be altered to fit your specific language needs (maybe you want to measure time in fortnights?).

It's as simple as `$('.timestamp').sexytime();` where .timestamp is the class of elements that contain your timestamp. You may need to pass in the current format of your timestamps.
